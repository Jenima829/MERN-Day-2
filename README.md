<!DOCTYPE html>: Specifies that this is an HTML5 document.
<html lang="en">: Declares the language of the document as English.

Key Sections in the Body:
Header: Displays a heading, "Namma Website," styled with a background color and large font size.
Product Table: Uses a <table> to arrange product items in a row.
Each product is placed inside a <td> (table cell) that contains a .container div for styling.
Each .container includes:
Product name (<h2>).
Product image (<img>).
Product price (<h2>).
Footer: Displays a footer with the text "Developed by us" styled similarly to the header.

2. CSS Styling
Body Styling:
margin: 0px; ensures no extra space around the webpage.
Container Styling:
border, border-radius, and flexbox properties create a neat layout for product cards.
The transition and :hover effects add interactivity, like scaling and changing the background color.
Image Styling:
Images are sized appropriately and styled with a border and rounded corners.
Specific classes (image2, image3, etc.) adjust dimensions for individual product images.
Header and Footer Styling:
Both have a consistent background color and center-aligned text with a large font size.
Table Cell Padding:
td { padding-left: 15px; } ensures spacing between product cards.
